# pygluqlo: a python gluqlo remake

Pygluqlo is a very basic and imperfect gluqlo translation to python and pygame. 

Gluqlo (or Глюкало, if you prefer) is a SDL remake of well-known awesome [Fliqlo screensaver](http://9031.com/goodies/#fliqlo) 
which is originally avaliable for Windows and OSX platforms only.

It is not yet complete.

It is my intention to keep it to work with at least these language and library versions in order to run it in an old XP computer:

## Basic Requirements

- python 2.7.9 (32bits)
- pygame 1.9.1

Optional: 
- py2exe 0.6.9 (for packaging)
